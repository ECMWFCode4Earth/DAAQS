### Reading the data

- The typical difference in reading the CAMS data and OPENAQ data is that CAMS data is organised parameter (species) wise while the OPENAQ data contains all the data at once. 
- The design choice is that we only keep data for one parameter in openAQ 
- If all the parameter has to be read then we for sure are doing more work, but we decided to keep it this way
